Place your local audio files here (no external CDNs):

- tick.mp3       – short click per slice boundary
- spin_loop.mp3  – gentle spinning loop (1–3s looped)
- stop.mp3       – soft stop/ding when wheel settles
- win.mp3        – celebratory fanfare/clap for gift wins
- lose.mp3       – short soft cue for try-again

All files are optional. If missing, the app falls back to generated tones.
